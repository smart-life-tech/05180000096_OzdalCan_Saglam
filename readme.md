To provide instructions on how to use your TextJedi interpreter and provide a clear guide, you can create a README.md file in your GitHub repository. The README file is a commonly used document for providing essential information about a project. Here's an example structure for your README file:

# TextJedi Interpreter

The TextJedi Interpreter is a program that allows you to run TextJedi programs and execute TextJedi code. This README provides instructions on how to use the interpreter and run TextJedi programs.

## Installation of the compiler

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/smart-life-tech/jediCompiler.git
   ```

2. Compile the source code using a C compiler:

   ```shell
   gcc -o TextJedi.exe TextJedi.c
   ```

   Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your machine.

## Usage

To run a TextJedi program, follow these steps:

1. Create a TextJedi program file (e.g., `program.txt`) containing your TextJedi code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the `TextJedi.exe` executable is located.

4. Run the interpreter by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   ./TextJedi.exe program.txt
   ```

   Replace `program.txt` with the path to your TextJedi program file.

5. The interpreter will execute the TextJedi program and display the output or any error messages in the terminal.

## Examples

Here are some example TextJedi programs:

1. `program.txt`:
   ```
   new text myString;
   myString := "Hello, TextJedi!";
   output myString;
   ```

   Running the program will output:
   ```
   Hello, TextJedi!
   ```

2. `program2.txt`:
   ```
   new int myNumber;
   myNumber := 42;
   output asText(myNumber);
   ```

   Running the program will output:
   ```
   42
   ```

Feel free to add more examples and explanations as needed to help users understand and utilize your TextJedi interpreter.
